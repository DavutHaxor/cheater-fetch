# cheater-fetch
A basic script using playwright to fetch some info i'd like to inspect about some cheaters.

## Usage
`npm run cheater-fetch`

Paste https://csstats.gg/player/$steamId link after program is open to fetch the info. I added 2 second delay since it takes some time for csst.at to load game count.
